#Incorrect Comparison in `my_function`

This repository demonstrates a simple bug in a Python function that incorrectly compares two numbers. The function `my_function` is intended to return the larger of two input numbers, but it contains a logic error that causes it to return the first number regardless of its value relative to the second.

## Bug Description

The function `my_function` has a bug in its comparison logic. When the first number (`a`) is less than the second number (`b`), the function should return `b`. However, due to the error, it returns `a`, resulting in incorrect outputs in certain cases.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `bug.py` script.  Observe the incorrect output when calling `my_function(2, 5)`.
3. Run the `bugSolution.py` script to see the correct implementation.

## Bug Solution

The bug is fixed in `bugSolution.py` by correcting the conditional statement to accurately compare the inputs and return the larger number.
